# PSR-0 application

PSR-0 is great because you can plug things in and out really easily
everywhere.

## Loading PSR-0 apps from Composer

The recommended way to load your PSR-0 app is by defining it in
`composer.json` as a Composer dependency. At the end of
`application/bootstrap.php` you'll see it already include the Composer
autoloader.

## Loading PSR-0 apps from within Kohana's classes

If you've merged your PSR-0 code in your `application/classes/` directory
rather than split it into a separate repository, you'll find that they've been
autoloaded too by Composer.

## Loading PSR-0 apps in a non-standard way

If you absolutely do want to load applications through some other non-standard
way, you can add it to Kohana's autoloader in `application/bootstrap.php`. An
example is already provided and commented out.

```
/**
 * Load vendor applications.
 */
// spl_autoload_register(function($class) { Kohana::auto_load($class, 'vendor/App/Core/src'); });
```

## Using PSR-0 apps

Use it just like you normally would. For example in `Controller_Foo` you
might have:

```
<?php

class Controller_Foo extends Controller_Core
{
    public function action_run()
    {
        $usecase = new App\Core\Usecase;
        $this->view->results = $usecase->execute();
    }
}
```
